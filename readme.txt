Project Overview
Virtual Assistant Functionality:

Speech Recognition: The assistant listens for commands using speech_recognition and responds accordingly.
Text-to-Speech: It uses gTTS and pygame to convert text responses into speech and play them back.
Commands and Actions:

Web Browsing: Can open websites such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn.
Music Playback: Searches for and plays songs using YouTube links stored in a musicLibrary.
News Updates: Fetches and reads out the latest news headlines using the NewsAPI.
AI Processing: Uses the OpenAI API to handle general queries and provide responses.
Error Handling and Logging:

Handles various errors related to speech recognition and API requests. The script prints traceback information for debugging.
Configuration and Security:

Currently, API keys are hardcoded, but ideally, they should be managed securely using environment variables.
Possible Enhancements:
Expand Commands:

You can add more commands for additional functionalities, such as setting reminders, providing weather updates, or controlling smart home devices.
User Customization:

Allow users to customize the assistant's behavior, responses, or preferred music sources.
Improved Performance:

Optimize the text-to-speech function to reduce delays and enhance the user experience.
User Interface:

Consider adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction, especially if you plan to expand functionality.
Security:

Use secure methods to manage sensitive information, such as API keys, to prevent exposure.
Integration:

Integrate with other APIs or services to provide more comprehensive features, like calendar management or email checking.
